# About the tutor

Hello!  I'm Stephen but my friends call me Sven.  I've been teaching and tutoring mathematics for over 10 years.  I have a     B.S. from Penn State and I'm currently doing preliminary mathematics coursework for graduate school where I will pursue a     PhD.  Stay tuned!  In my free time I like to practice yoga, read, cook and do freelance software engineering.
